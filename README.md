# 📝 Random Quote Generator

A **simple yet engaging** quote generator built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This mini-project displays a random quote from a predefined collection each time the **“New Quote”** button is clicked.

Ideal for practicing:

- ✅ Basic **DOM manipulation**
- ✅ Handling **click events**
- ✅ Working with **arrays and randomization**
- ✅ Creating lightweight interactive components

## 🚀 How It Works

1. An array of quotes is defined in JavaScript.
2. When the “New Quote” button is clicked, a random quote is selected.
3. The selected quote is displayed dynamically on the page using DOM manipulation.
